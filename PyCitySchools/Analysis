One noticable trend I observed was that, as the spending range per student increases, the overall passing rate decreases in this specific school district. 
This is evident in my pandas code when I created a table of spending ranges per student as an index, with scores portrayed along the row.


Another trend I realized when analyzing this data is that charter schools have much higher average, and passing scores accross the board. Intuitively it makes sense.
District are schools, they allow everyone thus, there is less emphasis on the quality of teaching that goes on there. This is eveident in my table where I seperated the 
scores to be pulled by School type.
